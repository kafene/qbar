# Q bar: portable omnibar

**Q bar** brings many search engines to one page.
You can type searched words or url address here.
You can assign keyword to different search engines.
For example, if want to find a video on YouTube, type:

    y Homer's life in 2 minutes 

It process `?q=` parameter, so it can be set as your default search engine.

It is only one html page with javascript, so it is pretty portable.

## What works

- listing of engines
- query processing
- engines can be edited in page source
- all urls are redirected

## Todo

- interface to edit engines and bookmarks
- saving edited config
- maybe synchronization with firefox
